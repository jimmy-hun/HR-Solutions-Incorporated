--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you know your file will live where your classes are, that directory will be on your class path. 
In that case, you can be sure that this solution will solve your problem:

java.net.URL path = ClassLoader.getSystemResource("myFile.txt");
if(path==null) 
{
	//The file was not found, insert error handling here
}

File f = new File(path.toURI());
reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(f));






NOTE THAT IT MUST BE IN THE 'src' FOLDER AND NOT IN A PACKAGE!!!
UNLESS YOU SPECIFY THE FOLDER PATHS ("files/myFile.txt")

OTHER WAY!!! [note that the above only works if only file is used and no output or input streams are involved)

String curDir = System.getProperty("user.dir") + "\\src\\???.txt";
1. System.getProperty("user.dir") will return the current working directory
2. \\ equates to "\" as a string in java
3. add the corresponding folders (src folder => others if exist)
4. add the file type to be read
